Why containers?

Move Faster
Automate More
Increased reliability
For less money

They are a technology that allows you to run a software on a variety of systems, including a developers laptop to a production system
This speeds up deployment, simplifies automation and ensure your code can run consistenlt on a production node as well as everywhere else
VM can host a software at a time where as many containers which is having different softwares can run on a single VM 

Orchestration -

Simply refers to processes used to manage containers

Zero downtime deployments -

Spinup containers running the new code
When they are fully up, direct user traffic to the new containers
Remove the old containers running the old code

Orchestration tools will do the above steps by automation

What are containers used for?

Software portability - Running software consistently on different machines
Isoloation - Good security, It will isolate software separate from on another
Scaling - Increasing/decreasing the resources (Ex- AWS Auto scaling)
Automation - saves money and time
Efficient resource utilization - Saves money

Advanatges of containers

The isolation and portability of VMs
More light-weight than VMs - Less resource usage
Faster than VMs - Containers can start in seconds not minutes
Smaller than VMs - Containes images can be measured in MBs not GBs

Limitations of containers

Less felxibility - You cant run a windows container on a linuc machine yet


What is DOCKER

Is primarily a container run time
At its core, docker allows you to run containers on systems
